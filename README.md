# wallstreetlocal
A website that allows you to view thousands of holdings, from the world's largest investors.

This repository holds the front-end code for wallstreetlocal, for the back-end, see [here](https://github.com/bruhbruhroblox/pinestreetlocal).


### SEC Filings
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) keeps record of every company in the United States. Companies whose holdings surpass $100 million though, are required to file a special type of form: the 13F form. This form, filed quarterly, discloses the filer's holdings, providing transparency into their investment activities and allowing the public and other market participants to monitor large institutional investors.

The problem is though, is that these holdings are often cumbersome to access, and valuable analysis is often hidden behind a paywall. Through **wallstreetlocal**, the SEC's 13F filers become more accessible and open.

* **Large:** With over 850,000 companies archived, any company registered with the SEC can be queried. Download the database [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LT4xiFJkh6YlAPQDcov8YIKqcvevFlEE/view).
* **Stocks:** View stocks in aggregation as the back-end collects and organizes holdings from individual filers. With thousands of cached stocks in our database, accurate and recent data is available for any evaluations.
* **Filings:** View individual filings and their holdings in the explorer, or visit the SEC directly.

## Installation

React has been designed for gradual adoption from the start, and **you can use as little or as much React as you need**:

* Use [Quick Start](https://react.dev/learn) to get a taste of React.
* [Add React to an Existing Project](https://react.dev/learn/add-react-to-an-existing-project) to use as little or as much React as you need.
* [Create a New React App](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project) if you're looking for a powerful JavaScript toolchain.

## Documentation

You can find the React documentation [on the website](https://react.dev/).  

Check out the [Getting Started](https://react.dev/learn) page for a quick overview.

The documentation is divided into several sections:

* [Quick Start](https://react.dev/learn)
* [Tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe)
* [Thinking in React](https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react)
* [Installation](https://react.dev/learn/installation)
* [Describing the UI](https://react.dev/learn/describing-the-ui)
* [Adding Interactivity](https://react.dev/learn/adding-interactivity)
* [Managing State](https://react.dev/learn/managing-state)
* [Advanced Guides](https://react.dev/learn/escape-hatches)
* [API Reference](https://react.dev/reference/react)
* [Where to Get Support](https://react.dev/community)
* [Contributing Guide](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html)

## Examples

We have several examples [on the website](https://react.dev/). Here is the first one to get you started:

```jsx
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

function HelloMessage({ name }) {
  return <div>Hello {name}</div>;
}

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('container'));
root.render(<HelloMessage name="Taylor" />);
```

This example will render "Hello Taylor" into a container on the page.

You'll notice that we used an HTML-like syntax; [we call it JSX](https://react.dev/learn#writing-markup-with-jsx). JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it feels like writing HTML.
